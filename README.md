## Savvi Financial

Collaborating with Savvi Financial, an online investment advisor, presented an exceptional opportunity for me to apply and expand my expertise in art direction, branding, and design within the fintech industry. Savvi Financial stands at the forefront of providing personalized financial planning and investment advice through digital platforms. The project's scope was to update and refresh the company's branding to better align with its innovative services and target audience's evolving expectations. This endeavor was not just about a visual makeover but about enhancing the brand's communication and connection with its users.

### My Role

As the art director, branding lead, and designer, my responsibilities were comprehensive and varied. I was charged with overseeing the project's creative vision and ensuring that every visual element—from graphics and layouts to icons and infographics—communicated the brand's values and objectives effectively. Developing a coherent and resonant brand identity was at the core of my role, alongside ensuring that our digital presence was both intuitive and visually engaging. My aim was to create a seamless and compelling user experience that mirrored the sophistication and personalization of Savvi Financial's services.

### Goals

The primary goal was to update Savvi Financial's branding to reflect the company's position as a leading online investment advisor. This update was crucial for staying relevant in a highly competitive market and for communicating the brand's commitment to providing cutting-edge financial advice and planning solutions. The new branding needed to appeal to our diverse clientele, from tech-savvy millennials to more seasoned investors, ensuring it communicated trust, expertise, and innovation.

### Design Process

My approach to revitalizing Savvi Financial's branding was strategic and iterative, involving several key stages:

1. **Interviewing Stakeholders:** I initiated the process by engaging with stakeholders within and outside the company. This included conversations with our team, current clients, and potential users to gain insights into their perceptions and expectations of the brand.

2. **Research and Insights Gathering:** Parallel to stakeholder interviews, I conducted comprehensive research on market trends, competitor branding, and design innovations within the fintech space. Understanding the broader industry context was essential for positioning Savvi Financial's branding effectively.

3. **Brand Identity Development:** Armed with insights, I led the development of the new brand identity. This phase was about more than selecting new colors or fonts; it was about crafting a visual language that encapsulated Savvi Financial's ethos and differentiated us in the marketplace. Every element, from typography to color schemes, was chosen to convey reliability, innovation, and accessibility.

4. **Web and Digital Asset Design:** Central to the branding update was the design of our web presence and digital assets. I focused on creating a layout that was not only visually appealing but also optimized for user experience, ensuring easy navigation and access to information. This included the redesign of icons and the creation of infographics that simplified complex financial concepts.

5. **Iterative Design and Feedback:** Throughout the design phase, I embraced an iterative process, incorporating feedback from internal teams and test users to refine our visuals and messaging. This collaborative approach ensured that the updated branding resonated well with our target audience and accurately reflected our brand's values.

6. **Finalization and Implementation:** The final phase involved the meticulous finalization of all design elements and their implementation across our digital platforms. Ensuring consistency and cohesiveness across all touchpoints was paramount to maintaining a strong brand identity.

This project with Savvi Financial was an intricate exercise in rebranding, pushing me to blend creativity with strategic thinking to redefine our brand identity. Through meticulous research, collaborative iteration, and thoughtful design, I aimed to forge a visual identity that not only aligned with Savvi Financial's innovative approach to investment advising but also engaged and inspired trust among our diverse clientele.
